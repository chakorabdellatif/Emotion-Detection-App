# Emotion Detection App  

## Overview  
This is an Android application that detects human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning. The app is built with **Android Studio** using **Java** and **XML** for the front-end. It integrates a **VGG16** model trained on the **AffectNet** dataset, classifying images into **7 emotion categories**.  

## Features  
- **Real-time emotion detection** from camera or gallery images  
- **Deep learning-based model** (VGG16 trained on AffectNet)  
- **Smooth Android UI** built with Java and XML  
- **Lightweight TensorFlow Lite** model for efficient on-device inference  

## Emotion Classes  
The model classifies images into the following **7 emotions**:  
1. Neutral  
2. Happy  
3. Sad  
4. Surprise  
5. Fear  
6. Disgust  
7. Anger  

## Tech Stack  
- **Android Studio** (Java, XML)  
- **TensorFlow Lite** for on-device inference  
- **VGG16** for deep learning-based facial emotion recognition  
- **AffectNet** dataset for training
