# Emotion Detection App  

## Overview  
This is an Android application that detects human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning. The app is built with **Android Studio** using **Java** and **XML** for the front-end. It integrates a **VGG16** model trained on the **AffectNet** dataset, classifying images into **7 emotion categories**.
